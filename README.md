#Tech Stack


- Frontend:React Native (Mobile App)  
- Backend:Node.js / Firebase  
- Database:** Firestore / Cloud Storage  
- Deployment:** AI Studio  


#UI
The application features a "Mission Control" style dashboard:
Tactical Map: A central dark-mode map displaying sensor nodes and risk heatmaps.
Telemetry Sidebar: Real-time feeds of Soil Moisture (%), Seismic Vibration (Hz), and Incline (Degrees).
Command Bar: Quick access to system health, AI report generation, and alert history.
#Output Schema
HillShield uses a standardized JSON schema across all modules to ensure seamless communication between IoT hardware and the dashboard.
1. Sensor Telemetry Schema
This is the payload sent from the physical sensor nodes in the field to the HillShield backend.
**JSON Body:**
```json

  "node_id": "HS-SEC-07G",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-28T15:30:00Z",
  "coordinates": {
    "lat": 27.7172,
    "lng": 85.3240
